4.1 Programme - Propose target date for start of competition 3rd Week March 2021; Duration 10 days.

4.2 Competition Budget - Due to recent rise in price of METRIC tokens I have revised the prize pool as outlined in item 2.1 to a greatly reduced abount, roughly equivalent to 3% of the existing treasury. I think this is a more appropriate use of treasury funds than the previous allocation.
